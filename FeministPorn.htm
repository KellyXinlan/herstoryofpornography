        <h1>A Story about Feminist Pornography</h1>
        <p>Now both Zeus and Hera want pleasure, and both see its exercise as a form of personal power...But they are a little uncertain how best to do this, and so, without consulting Teiresias(who now really is too old and blind to be of any help), they decide to rent some videotapes and settle down to watch in the privay of their own home. The first one they rent scandalizes Hera. It shows a penis in clodse-up ejaculating all over a woman's face and the woman acting like the semen is a gift from the gods. Hera criticizes the film's lack of realism. Zeus is surprised at her reaction. He liked the phallic show of power; it reminded him of his thunderbolts. They rent another. Hera likes this one better; it shows a couple experimenting with a wide variety of sexual acts, livening up their relationship. Zeus takes notes again; alothough this isn't like watching stag films with the other male gods, it has its advantages.</p>

        <h2>The Feminists' Argument and the Emergence of Feminist Pornography</h2>
        <p>Dating from the feminist sex wars during the late 1970s and the 1980s, anti-pornography feminists and sex-positive feminists had a series of intense debates about various topics including prostitution, sexuality, sadomasochism, etc. Among all the contested topics,  pornography evoked the most intense discussion. <br>According to Carolyn Bronstein’s Battling Pornography: The American Feminist Anti-Pornography Movement, 1976-1986, because of the emergence of various social phenomena including the sexual revolution’s failure to liberate women in 1960s, the growth of the radical feminist wing of the Women’s Liberation movement who regarded men as the threats to women, and the rise of commercial pornography industry, organizations including Women Against Violence Against Women (WAVAW), Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media (WAVPM), Women Against Pornography (WAP) came into being. <br>At the very beginning of the anti-pornography movement, WAVAW, WAVPM, and WAP tried to resist and disrupt mainstream media images and representations which glorified violence towards women or reinforced gender stereotypes, implanting sexist attitudes. Among those three groups, only WAVPM believed that pornography was central to women’s oppression. However, during the later development, the focus of those three groups became pornography because “fighting pornography was a way of launching an all-out war against male sexual violence” (Bronstein, 2011, p. 8). One of the backlashes of this shift is that the heterogenous feminist groups were unified into anti-pornography feminists and represented by a single MacKinnon-Dworkin anti-pornography argument. The MacKinnon-Dworkin argument was proposed by two central figures of anti-pornography feminism:  Cathrine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin. They think that even though pornography was defended as an expression of idea and image, it violated women because pornography objectifies women by depicting them as the sexual objects for men’s sexual desires. Besides, MacKinnon and Dworkin also argued that the pornography industry sexually abuses women. <br>Anti-pornography feminists’ arguments incurred sex-positive feminists’ discontents.  Gayle Rubin, who is a sex-positive feminist scholar,  wrote an article called Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality in which Rubin asserted that the dehumanizing and sexist misrepresentations of women in pornography, as well as the exploitation of women in the pornography industry, are caused by gender inequality in the industry instead of the pornography itself. Also, from Rubin’s perspective, the sexist situation in the pornography industry can be changed.<br>As an echo of Rubin’s argument, the notion of creating different pornography came into being. According to Tristan Taormino’s (2013) book  The Feminist Porn Book: The Politics of Producing Pleasure, a group of female porn performers who worked during the golden age, including Annie Sprinkle, Candida Royalle, and Gloria Leonard, formed a support group called Club 90 in New York City. In 1984, the feminist arts collective Carnival Knowledge asked Club 90 to participate in a festival called The Second Coming, and explore the question, “Is there a feminist pornography?” It is one of the first documented times when feminists publicly posed and examined this critical query (Taormino, 2013, p.11). <br>Still, in 1984, Candida Royalle founded Femme Productions to direct feminist porn. Feminists including Susie Bright, Nina Hartley, Annie Sprinkle started their business in the pornography field. That’s how feminist pornography came into being. In 2006, the Feminist Porn Awards (FPAs) was established. FPAs established the criteria as well as the definition of feminist pornography: (1) A woman had a hand in the production, writing, direction, etc.of the work; (2) It depicts genuine female pleasure; and/or (3) It expands the boundaries of sexual representation on film and challenges stereotypes that are often found in mainstream porn.

Major studios, including Vivid, VCA, and Wicked, began producing their own lines of couples porn that reflected Royalle’s vision and generally followed a formula of softer, gentler, more romantic porn with storylines and high production values. The growth of the “couples porn” genre signified a shift in the industry: female desire and viewership were finally acknowledged, if narrowly defined. This provided more selection for female viewers and more opportunities for women to direct mainstream heterosexual films, including Veronica Hart and Kelly Holland.
